This benchmark has been converted to SAC. The result of the SAC generated 
code has been compared with the orginal Rodina version and they seem to match
quite well (however, due to tiny roundoff errors, there is slight difference).
Also, to make these two version comparable, we also need to manaully change
the random function "SACrandom" of SAC to the stdlib.h random function "rand"
The original Rodinia version has also been modified so we now have two new
kernels which do not utilise the shared memory at all. The prupose of this
is to compare to the performance of kernel with and without shared memory on
the new Fermi architecture, which features hardware managed L1/L2 cache. The
runtime results seem to show that utilising shared memory is *less* efficient.
