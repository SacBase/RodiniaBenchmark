* bfs
This benchmark has not been converted to SAC yet. It is a bit difficult because: to 
parallelise the parallel for loop, i.e. the one with OpenMP pragma, we need to convert
it into a WITH-loop. However, the two output arrays of this for loop, i.e. cost and
updating_graph_mask, can not be computed on a one-to-one mapping specified by the 
WITH-loop. This is because, during each iteration of the outermost for loop, a parent
essentilly traverse each of each sons and update the corresponding element in the cost
and updating_graph_mask arrays. However, the sons can be anywhere within the two arrays
and such position does not need to corresponding to the parent's position. Also, in 
this case, each parent essentially produce more than one element, which does not match
the sematics of a WITH-loop, which specifies that each iteration only produces one and
only one element. So we postpone this bencahmark and it needs further consideration.
