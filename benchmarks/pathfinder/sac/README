Interesting Note
================

 * This code, when compiled with `-doPRA`, causes the compiler to
   crash in `opt:wrci`.
 * Additionally, with `-doEXPAR` when using CUDA*, the compiler has an assertion fail:
```
Internal compiler error
Assertion "NODE_TYPE( decl) == N_arg" failed at sac2c/src/libsac2c/cuda/adjust_stknl_rets.c:507 -- Declaration of avis is not N_arg!
```
